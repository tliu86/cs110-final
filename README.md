# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

In the backend folder (create a terminal within the backend), you can run

### `npm run dev` 

Runs the backened server to connect it with the MongoDB cluster.\

After running both commands in different terminals, you should be able to have a fully functioning full-stack website.\
